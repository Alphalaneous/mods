## About

**Editor Collab**, or Tulip Editor is a live multiplayer editor collaboration tool designed for all kinds of people from casual creators to megacollab hosts.

## Help, Bugs, Crashes, Questions, Feature Requests

If you need any help with the mod, or encountered an issue, feel free to either message me on Discord (alk1m123#3076), or create a [Github issue](https://github.com/altalk23/EditorCollab/issues/new/choose).

## Usage

Account related stuff are in the options menu. Press the "TE" button to access the account settings. Here you can create an account, log into your account and change your password. If you got the host permissions from the Patreon, either message me on Discord or fill out the form sent to you so I can add your hosting features.

### Users

When you open your created levels, there exists a button in the top left side of the screen, that is the button you use to join levels with a 8 letter level code. When you are in the editor, there is a button on the top right of the pause menu, which gives you the user list.

### Hosts 

For hosts, when you open a level, you will see a button on the top right side of the screen, the share button. This button opens an menu that you can share your level from. "Share" button will share the currently opened level, and "Stop sharing" will stop the sharing of that level. "Copy to clipboard" copies the level code to your clipboard. While you are still sharing the level, you can use the "Recover" feature to get a global undo and redo screen, in which you can change which actions are done.

The default sharing of the level determines who can join. Restricted means only the people you have whitelisted can join, viewer means people can join with the level code but can't edit, and editor means they can edit the level. In the next page of this menu, there is a user list. This is the whitelisted users and seperate from the default sharing. This means you can share your level with specific people and no one else can join even if they somehow found out the level code. This provides a secure way of collaborating with your users.

In the user list inside the pause menu, you will see X buttons next to the users. You can kick specific users using this feature. Ban feature is coming soon!
